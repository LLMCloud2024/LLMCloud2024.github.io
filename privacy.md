We will process the data only as long as is needed for the preparation, organisation and follow-up of the event and the documentation for our funders, or for compliance with any legal obligations on archiving data. You can withdraw your consent at any time for the future and - unless there are any legal obligations which prevent this - we will earase your data without undue delay.
